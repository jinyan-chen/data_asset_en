# Subscribing to Alert Data
This guide introduces how to configure alert data subscription on EnOS Console and consume alert data with the Java SDK provided by EnOS.

## Prerequisites
- Access permission to the Data Subscription module.
- Device connection is completed, and the devices are uploading data to EnOS.
- A workstation with IDE (IDEA or Eclipse) installed.

## About This Task
**Goal**

The goal of this guide is to configure subscription to the alert data of measure point *test_raw*.

**Data Preparation**

- **Model configuration**: Detailed information about the (*testModel*) for this guide is as follows：

| Feature Type  | Name     | Identifier | Point Type | Data Type |
|:--------------|:---------|:-----------|:-----------|:----------|
| Measure Point | test_raw | test_raw   | AI         | DOUBLE    |

- **Data ingestion**: Alert settings are configured for monitoring the data of the *test_raw* measure point. For information about data ingestion, see [Device Connection](https://www.envisioniot.com/docs/device-connection/en/latest/quickstart/gettingstarted_device_connection.html).
- **Alert Configuration**: For information about alert configuration for devices, see [Alert Management](https://www.envisioniot.com/docs/device-connection/en/latest/howto/alert/alert_overview.html).

## Procedure
The steps for subscribing and consuming alert data are as follows:
- Create and configure an alert data subscription topic
- Save and enable the subscription topic
- Get subscribed data with Java SDK
- Check the data consumption results

## Step 1. Create and configure a data subscription topic
Log in EnOS Console and select the **Subscription Service** module. All the subscription topics created for the current organization are listed in the table. Take the following steps to create and configure an alert data subscription topic.

1. **Create topic**: Click the **New Subscription** button and complete the configuration for the topic. For this guide, select **Alert Data Subscription** as the type.
2. **Subscription ID**: Choose to input or generate an ID for the subscription topic.
3. **Select SA account**: Each consumer instance must have an associated SA account, which can be generated by registering an application on EnOS. For instructions, see [Managing Applications](https://www.envisioniot.com/docs/app-development/en/latest/managing_apps.html).
4. **Select customers to be subscribed**: Each SA can access the data of multiple customers (through purchasing applications). Select the customers whose data are to be subscribed to.
5. **Set model filter**: Select the model to be subscribed to. For this guide, select *testModel*. The subscription system will filter alert data to meet the specified condition.
6. **Set device tag filter**: Specify tags of devices so that data of the selected devices will be subscribed to.

## Step 2. Save and enable the subscription topic
After the subscription topic is configured, click **Save** to save the configuration. On the **Data Subscription** page, find the saved topic, click the **Enable** icon to start the subscription topic.

## Step 3. Get subscribed data with Java SDK
EnOS provides Java SDK to help developers with offline application development and data consumption.
- Add [Maven dependency](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.envisioniot/enos-subscribe/2.0.0) for the SDK. See the following example:

```
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.envisioniot</groupId>
  <artifactId>enos-subscribe</artifactId>
  <version>2.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```
- Use IDE for offline application development. See the following code sample:

```
String sub_server_host ="sub_server_host";
int sub_server_port ="sub_server_port";
String accessKey ="accessKey";
String accessSecret ="accessSecret";
String subId = "subscriptionId";
String consumerGroup = "consumerGroup";

/* service */
EOSClient eosClient = new EOSClient(sub_server_host, sub_server_port, accessKey, accessSecret);
IAlertService alertService = eosClient.getAlertService();

/* handler */
IAlertHandler alertHandler = new IAlertHandler(){
    @Override
    public void eventRead(Alert alert) {
        System.out.println(alert);
    }
};

/* subscribe */
alertService.subscribe(alertHandler, subId);

/* subscribe with consumer group (optional) */
alertService.subscribe(alertHandler, subId, consumerGroup);
```
.. note:: In this sample, the `sub_server_host` and `sub_server_port` are the host and port of the subscription server, which vary with the cloud region and instance. For private cloud instances, contact your Envision project manager or support representative to get the host and port information.

For more information about the SDK, see [Data Subscription SDK Reference](../reference/data_subscription_sdk).

## Step 4. Check the data consumption results

Run the application for data consumption and check the data consumption results in the logs of the application.
