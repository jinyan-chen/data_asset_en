# Creating a Storage Policy Group
Data storage policy groups support separate storage policy configuration of different projects or domains for easy management. Each storage policy group has the same set of storage types. Before configuring data storage policy for your asset data, you need to create a storage policy group.

Take the following steps to create a storage policy group.

1. Log in EnOS Console and select the **Storage Policy** module. 
2. Click **Create Group** or the **+** icon to create a storage policy group. Then, complete the basic configuration of the storage policy group.

- **Group Name**: Enter a name for the storage policy group. Chinese characters, English letters, underscores, and hyphens are supported.
- **Group Model**: Each storage policy group must associate with at least one asset model, so that storage policies can be configured for measure points of the model. Note that a model cannot be associated with 2 storage policy groups.

See the following screen capture for creating a storage policy group.
